* Description
Useful Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp macros and functions.

(For me "Common Lisp" means "sbcl"; part of the CL-code will probably not work in other CL dialects.)

* Files
1. [[file:generated/functions.el][functions.el]], [[file:generated/file-functions.el][file-functions.el]], and [[file:generated/file-functions.lisp][file-functions.lisp]] contains functions,
2. [[file:generated/macros.el][macros.el]] and [[file:generated/macros.lisp][macros.lisp]] simplify my lisp code,
3. [[file:generated/logging.el][logging.el]] is a simple emacs logging system,
4. [[file:generated/dot.emacs][dot.emacs]] is (almost) a copy of my =~/.emacs=, and
5. [[file:generated/cl.el][cl.el]] will probably be used some day as a replacement for the standard ~cl.el~.

The files in the ~generated/~ folder are only included for convenience and can be easilly (re)generated from [[file:goodies.org][goodies.org]] using =M-x org-babel-tangle= in =emacs= or just =make=.
