* Description
These are my eLisp macros and functions used in different projects.

* Files
1. ~functions.el~ contains functions that I almost for sure will need in 3+ projects.
2. ~macros.el~ makes my eLisp code more elegant.
3. ~logging.el~ is a simple logging system; used mainly for debugging purposes.

The files ~functions.el~, ~macros.el~, ~logging.el~, and ~examples.el~ in the ~generated/~ folder are only included for convenience
and can be easilly (re)generated from ~goodies.org~ using =M-x org-babel-tangle= in =emacs= or just =make=.
