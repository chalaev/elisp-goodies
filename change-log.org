Change log for my [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies][(e)Lisp Goodies]].

* Packaging eLisp code
** 2020-12-07
Moved some code out of [[file:packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]] adding bew files:
1. [[file:generated/load.el][load.el]] provides =load*= function for loading non-packaged code,
2. [[file:generated/local-packages.el][local-packages.el]] helps to =require= local (unavailable from ELPA) packages like [[file:packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]], and
3. [[file:generated/make.el][make.el]] contains elisp code used in [[file:Makefile][Makefile]]s.

** 2020-12-04
1. (See [[file:Makefile][Makefile]].) Packaged el-code by putting =generated/*.el=  (except for ~dot.emacs~) into =~/.emacs.d/local-packages/shalaev.el=; later I will probably split it into different files.
2. Updated section "emacs configuration in ~/.emacs" in [[file:shalaev.org][shalaev.org]]

* September-October 2020
Decided to share some of my macros and functions

** 2020-11-28
Started adding tests for elisp code.

*** 2020-12-02
1. Added ~dolist-collect~ replacing CL's =(loop for x in my-list collect ...)=.
2. Renamed ~find~ â†’ ~s-find~ in order to distinguish it from ~find~ defined in ~cl.el~.
   Added tests for ~s-find~.

** 2020-11-18
packaged the Common Lisp part of the code

*** 2020-11-27

** 2020-11-17
updated "if-let" + "ifn-let" + (CL) "when-let" + "needs-set" + "cond-let"
(Before this update the code was barely useful.)
