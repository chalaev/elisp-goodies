*Files*
1. [[file:generated/functions.el][functions.el]], [[file:generated/file-functions.el][file-functions.el]], and [[file:generated/files.lisp][files.lisp]] contain functions,
2. [[file:generated/macros.el][macros.el]] and [[file:generated/macros.lisp][macros.lisp]] simplify my lisp code,
3. [[file:generated/logging.el][logging.el]] is a simple emacs logging system,
4. [[file:generated/dot.emacs][dot.emacs]] is (almost) a copy of my =~/.emacs=,
5. [[file:generated/cl.el][cl.el]] will probably be used some day as a replacement for the standard [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-lib.el][cl.el]],
6. [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] is used by =make= to compile, test, and package;
   typical output of successful =make= is saved in [[file:generated/el-tests.log][el-tests.log]] and [[file:generated/make.log][make.log]];
   the resulting package files are available in [[file:packaged/][packaged/]] directory,
7. [[file:shalaev.asd][shalaev.asd]] and [[file:headers.org][headers.org]] describe Common Lisp packages created by =make= according to [[file:Makefile][Makefile]],
8. [[file:helpers/][helpers/*]] assist compilation in [[file:Makefile][Makefile]], and
9. [[file:bash/][bash/*]] file(s) assist using ~emacsclient~ from ~bash~.

The files in the ~generated/~ folder are only included for convenience and can be easilly (re)generated using =make=.
(If =make= freezes, that's probably because =emacs= is waiting for your permission to evaluate the code at the beginning of [[file:shalaev.org][shalaev.org]].)
