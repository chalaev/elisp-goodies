* Description
These are my eLisp macros and functions used in different projects.

* Files
1. [[file:functions.el][functions.el]] contains functions that I almost for sure will need in 3+ projects.
2. [[file:macros.el][macros.el]] simplifies my eLisp code.
3. [[file:logging.el][logging.el]] is a simple logging system; used mainly for debugging purposes.
4. [[file:dot.emacs][dot.emacs]] is (almost) the copy of my =~/.emacs=
5. [[file:cl.el][cl.el]] will probably be used some day as a replacement for the standard ~cl.el~.

The files [[file:functions.el][functions.el]], [[file:macros.el][macros.el]], [[file:logging.el][logging.el]], [[file:dot.emacs][dot.emacs]], and [[file:cl.el][cl.el]] in the ~generated/~ folder are only included for convenience
and can be easilly (re)generated from [[file:goodies.org][goodies.org]] using =M-x org-babel-tangle= in =emacs= or just =make=.

* Support
