* Description
Useful Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp macros and functions.

(For me "Common Lisp" means "sbcl"; part of the CL-code will probably not work in other CL dialects.)

* Quick start
** Emacs Lisp code
Copy [[file:generated][generated/]]*.el files into the directory where your ~emacs~ can find them and load them.
** Common Lisp code
There are two options:
1. Copy-paste or load [[file:generated][generated/]]*.lisp into your projects, or
2. =make= to package them and =(require :shalaev)= in your code.
   (You might want to update your [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]] directory in ~Makefile~ before you =make=.)
   Still for the time being I can not replace =(eval-when (:compile-toplevel) (load "macros.lisp"))= with =:depends-on (... :shalaev)= in package declaractions,
   see the notes in [[https://github.com/chalaev/cl-simple-logger/blob/master/simple-log.org][simple-log package]].

* Files
1. [[file:generated/functions.el][functions.el]], [[file:generated/file-functions.el][file-functions.el]], and [[file:generated/file-functions.lisp][file-functions.lisp]] contain functions,
2. [[file:generated/macros.el][macros.el]] and [[file:generated/macros.lisp][macros.lisp]] simplify my lisp code,
3. [[file:generated/logging.el][logging.el]] is a simple emacs logging system,
4. [[file:generated/dot.emacs][dot.emacs]] is (almost) a copy of my =~/.emacs=, and
5. [[file:generated/cl.el][cl.el]] will probably be used some day as a replacement for the standard [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-lib.el][cl.el]],
6. [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] is used by =make=,
7. [[file:shalaev.asd][shalaev.asd]] describes the Common Lisp package created by =make= according to [[file:Makefile][Makefile]].

The files in the ~generated/~ folder are only included for convenience and can be easilly (re)generated from [[file:goodies.org][goodies.org]] using =M-x org-babel-tangle= in =emacs= or just =make=.
