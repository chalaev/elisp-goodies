Change log for my [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies][(e)Lisp Goodies]].

* Lazy Improvements
*** 01/06 Emacs Lisp
Used =letf= to name my new macro, but this name is already taken.
So renamed =letf= → =lett=

*** 01/05 Emacs Lisp
1. replaced (probably useless) =flet= with (new macro) =letf=
2. renamed =packaged/start.el= → [[file:packaged/batch-start.el][packaged/batch-start.el]]

*** 01/04 Emacs Lisp
1. re-wrote =s-find=,
2. added another test for it, and
3. moved =update-conf= from [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud][cloud project]]

*** 12/31 Common Lisp
exported symbols in =(defpackage :shalaev ...)=

* Packaging eLisp code
** fat removal
(For some macros/functions) switching to conditions (exceptions) instead of returning =(nil . :error-reason)= in case of problems.
*** 12/28
1. Moved several code pieces from [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud][cloud project]] to [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies][lisp-goodies]] because I will use them in my new [[https://github.com/chalaev/el-backup][el-backup project]].
2. Decided that some functions/macros are not really useful and erased them: =mv=, =cp=, =safe-insert-file=, =safe-mkdir=, =cons-to-list=.

** 2020-12-07
Moved some code out of [[file:packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]] adding bew files:
1. [[file:generated/load.el][load.el]] provides =load*= function for loading non-packaged code,
2. [[file:generated/local-packages.el][local-packages.el]] helps to =require= local (unavailable from ELPA) packages like [[file:packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]], and
3. [[file:generated/make.el][make.el]] contains elisp code used in [[file:Makefile][Makefile]]s.

These files are merged into [[file:packaged/start.el][packaged/start.el]] which is loaded by my =~/.emacs= at start:

=(load-file "~/projects/lisp-goodies/packaged/start.el")=

*** 2020-12-14
1. upgraded =make-temp-file= on emacs versions ≤25
2. (ELisp) removed =when-let= and =if-let=
3. added [[file:generated/make.log][make.log]]

*** 2020-12-11
1. added (ELisp) =emacs-ver=
2. added =mv=, =cp=, =when-let*= 
3. updated =when-let=

*** 2020-12-09
It was all about ELisp this time.
1. Added [[file:bash/detect-emacs.sh][detect-emacs.sh]] and simplified [[file:.login][~/.login]] accrodingly.
2. Removed my =if-let= elisp-code because it is already defined in ~subr-x.el~.
3. made =safe-mkdir= recursive (elisp).
4. added =ensure-dir-exists= (elisp).

*** 2020-12-22
minor updates

** 2020-12-04
1. (See [[file:Makefile][Makefile]].) Packaged el-code by putting =generated/*.el=  (except for ~dot.emacs~) into =~/.emacs.d/local-packages/shalaev.el=; later I will probably split it into different files.
2. Updated section "emacs configuration in ~/.emacs" in [[file:shalaev.org][shalaev.org]]

* September-October 2020
Decided to share some of my macros and functions

** 2020-11-28
Started adding tests for elisp code.

*** 2020-12-02
1. Added ~dolist-collect~ replacing CL's =(loop for x in my-list collect ...)=.
2. Renamed ~find~ → ~s-find~ in order to distinguish it from ~find~ defined in ~cl.el~.
   Added tests for ~s-find~.

** 2020-11-18
packaged the Common Lisp part of the code

*** 2020-11-27
added this Change Log

*** 2020-11-24
added (sb-rt) tests

** 2020-11-17
updated "if-let" + "ifn-let" + (CL) "when-let" + "needs-set" + "cond-let"
(Before this update the code was barely useful.)
